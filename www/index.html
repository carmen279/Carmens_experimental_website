            <p class="main__p"> The dog that you can see in the picture of my house is Lassie. She is a 14yo German Shepperd mix with Setter. She has been a loving member of our family all her life. She once gained sofa benefits and never lost them. Although she is quite elder she still has the soul of a puppy.</p>

            <p class="main__p"> But we also have cats! Most of them life freely outside. But one of them decided to be a house cat.</p>

            <p class="main__p"> There's a beach called Rodiles close to Villaviciosa. That's my favourite place. My grandparents took me there every summer when I was little, then, I started going there with friends and it lead to a point where I couldn't be a long time without going there.</p>
            <p class="main__p"> Furthermore, in summer of 2019 my sister and I joined the Red Cross to volunteer there to acompany and help people with movility issues so they can experience the beach like we all do. That lead to new amazing friendships and so much fun and we still continue doing it every summer since then</p>
